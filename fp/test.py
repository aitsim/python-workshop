# To summarise the difference, mutable objects can change their state or
#  contents and immutable objects can’t change their state or content.
# Immutable Objects : These are of in-built types like int, float, bool, string, unicode, 
# tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can’t be changed after it is created.


# Mutable Objects : These are of type list, dict, set .
#  Custom classes are generally mutable.
